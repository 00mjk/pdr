<h1>PDR: Docs: Instructor notes</h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the main documents page</a></p>

<p>This page is meant to be a set of notes to the instructor(s) of the course.  It is certainly not secret, but not likely to be all that interesting to the students.  But students are certainly welcome to read it!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../labs/lab01/index.html">Lab 1</a> (introduction): the in-lab requires getting through The &lsquo;Rational Example&rsquo; section of the <a href="../slides/02-cpp.html">C++ slide set</a>, and ideally the &lsquo;Pre-Processor&rsquo; section as well.</li>
<li><a href="../labs/lab04/index.html">Lab 4</a> (numbers): requires the use of command-line parameters for the post-lab, and those are discussed in the <a href="../slides/05-arrays-bigoh.html">Arrays &amp; Big-Oh slide set</a></li>
<li><a href="../labs/lab05/index.html">Lab 5</a> (trees): requires getting through the sections in the <a href="../slides/06-trees.html">Trees slide set</a> on expression trees and AVL trees (this information is needed for all three parts of the lab)</li>
