<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the main documents page</a></p>

<p>For some of the lab deliverables, you will need to submit a PDF file.
You can edit this in any editor of your choice, as long as the file
that you submit is a PDF.  There are a number of free ways to convert
your file.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, or a similar online
document editor, that can export to PDF</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> or
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>.  Both are free software,
and are similar to Microsoft Office.  To export to a PDF choose File
-> Export As PDF.  Both install on Linux and Windows; for Mac OS X,
you will want to look at
<a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice</a></li>
<li>You can install a free utility called
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/">PDFCreator</a>, which
will install a printer entry on your machine that will all you to
print to a PDF file.</li>
<li>You can use free online PDF conversion tools, such as <a href="http://www.freepdfconvert.com/">Free PDF
Convert</a> to convert it for you</li>
<li>Under Linux, you can print directly to a file - just be sure to
choose PDF as the file format, not PS</li>
</ul>
