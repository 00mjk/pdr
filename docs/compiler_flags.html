<h1>Useful compiler flags</h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the main documents page</a></p>

<p>This page is intended to summarize the various compiler flags that we
will be learning throughout the semester.  There are hundreds (if not
thousands!) of such options; we&rsquo;ll only be dealing with a few of them.</p>

<p>These flags are for the clang compiler, but the are mostly the same
for the g++ compiler (the only difference, of the ones listed below,
are the flags to generate the particualr assembly flavor).</p>

<ul>
<li>-O2: Creates an optimized executable.  Note that if you are using
the -c command (below), then you should call -O2 for those as well
as the final linker call.</li>
<li>-c &lt;filename.cpp>: This flag will compile BUT NOT LINK the passed
.cpp file.  It will create a filename.o file.  To create the
executable, you must call the compiler with all the .o files
(i.e. &lsquo;clang *.o&rsquo;)</li>
<li>-o <filename>: This will save the output executable into
<filename>.exe (or, in Linux/Unix, just <filename>).  For example,
&lsquo;clang -o foo foo.cpp&rsquo; will compile the foo.cpp file and name the
executable &lsquo;foo.exe&rsquo; (or just &lsquo;foo&rsquo;).  If you do out specify this
flag, the output is saved to a.exe (or a.out in Linux/Unix).  The &lsquo;o&rsquo;
in &lsquo;-o&rsquo; stands for output (as in output file).</li>
<li>-g: Include debugging information in the executable file.  This is
needed to debug the file in gdb.</li>
<li>-Wall: Display all warning messages.  An error will prevent the
program from being compiled, whereas a warning will not.  There are
many types of warnings that can be displayed, some of which are
rather obscure.  The &lsquo;all&rsquo; part means to display all of them.  It is
a good idea to use this, as warnings are often bugs in your program.</li>
<li>-S: generate assembly output, and then stop (i.e. does not compile
the program beyond the x86 assembly).  Note that the assembly format
that is created as a result of this flag has a different format than
what we have seen in lecture &ndash; the idea is the same, but the
register specification is different, and the destination/source order
is reversed for the commands.</li>
<li>-mllvm &ndash;x86-asm-syntax=intel: sets the assembly output format to
the flavor that we are used to in (this is the only flag on this
list that is not the same in g++)</li>
<li>-MM: generates dependencies in the format used in Makefiles</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to see all of the clang options, enter &lsquo;man clang&rsquo; at the
Linux prompt.  It&rsquo;s quite a list!</p>
