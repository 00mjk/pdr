PDR: Docs: Instructor notes
===========================

[Go up to the main documents page](index.html)

This page is meant to be a set of notes to the instructor(s) of the course.  It is certainly not secret, but not likely to be all that interesting to the students.  But students are certainly welcome to read it!
