Instructor notes
================

[Go up to the main documents page](index.html)

This page is meant to be a set of notes to the instructor(s) of the
course.  It is certainly not secret, but not likely to be all that
interesting to the students.  But students are certainly welcome to
read it!



Things to fix
-------------

To fix for next time (fall 2014):

- The shared folders description in [Tutorial 1: Introduction to UNIX:
  VirtualBox use](../tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html)
  apparently need updating (see ticket #1391).


Lecture progress
----------------

- [Lab 1](../labs/lab01/lab01.html): the in-lab requires getting
  through The 'Rational Example' section of the [C++ slide
  set](../slides/02-cpp.html), and ideally the 'Pre-Processor' section
  as well.
