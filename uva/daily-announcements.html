## Anonymous Feedback Fun
- "Why are we being made to go through an unnecessary amount of github files? It's not like we're learning how to use github from this. It's easy to set up github pages as a website and just make this a proper webpage. It might be worth one person's additional effort because it would save ~600+ people a good amount of time per semester. I would even volunteer helping set up a proper website using github pages if you want, similar to the one they have for 2102. Just ask in class, I'm sure a bunch of students know how github pages works."
