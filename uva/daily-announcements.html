## Pop Quiz!

I have started on [Lab 2](../../../../labs/lab02/index.html) (lists), and I think:

1. It's easy!
2. It's hard, but doable
3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.

## Lecture 6: Monday, February 1st
- Office hours are in full swing; see the [Google calendar](https://t.co/9kRXZnqkxZ) for details
- Registration issues: the class is now full
  - If there are any drops before the add/drop deadline, then those spots will be filled from the wait lists
  - I'm sorry if you don't get in -- these enrollment issues are not decided by me, but I have a list of people you can complain to
- [Lab 2](../labs/lab02/index.html) is out -- how are they going?
  - Tutorial 2: debugging has two flavors: [gdb](../tutorials/02-gdb/index.html) and [lldb](../tutorials/02-lldb/index.html). Which one you should do is discussed in [lab 2](../labs/lab02/index.html).
- Remember that you ***MUST*** do the in-labs from a lab computer!  You can't use your own personal laptops in that room.
- Email root@cs.virginia.edu for lab login issues, as we can't fix that ourselves
- Lecture recordings are posted online in a Flash movie format; see the [uva/index.html](index.html) file for the links
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/directtool/c9a32516-382f-449d-86b1-f738d75a2015/)!  It's through Collab
- Interested in installing Linux?  We suggest Ubuntu; speak to us for details
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- Today we will continue with [C++](../slides/01-cpp.html#/), which will take us into Wednesday
  - Next up: [lists](../slides/02-lists.html#/)
