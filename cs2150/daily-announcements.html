## Lecture 13: Wednesday, February 12th, 2014

- Office hours are in full swing, see the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1ea0dfillqvhlop8d7t0m8afuo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America/New_York) for details
  - They will be cancelled on Wednesday and Thursday of next week due to the midterm
- [Lab 3](../labs/lab03/index.html) is out to be graded
- [Lab 4](../labs/lab04/index.html) is out -- how is it going?
- Next week is the first midterm (yay?)
  - There will be a review session (likely Sunday at 8 p.m.)
  - Thus, there will not be a lab released this week
- UNIX honor pledge
  - If you haven't signed one, you can print it out (it's in the repo on the [cs2150/index.html](index.html) page; the direct link is [here](unix-honor-pledge-s14.pdf)), sign it, and bring it to me in lecture
  - You can't use [Geany](http://www.geany.org), which is an IDE, and the default file load action on the lab computers
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format; from [cs2150/index.html](index.html), click on the right-most link in the 'Semester Schedule' table
  - I think I have fixed the annoying zoom-to-upper-left-corner-and-stay-there "feature" of the recordings
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/page/a2056666-5b8f-40b6-8591-f73174a47bbf)!  It's through Collab
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are listed in the github repo
- Today we will be working through the [Arrays & Big-Oh](../slides/05-arrays-bigoh.html) slide set
  - Some of the content in [Arrays & Big-Oh](../slides/05-arrays-bigoh.html) is fair game for the test; full details on Friday
  - Up next: [Trees](../slides/06-trees.html)

## Lecture 5: Friday, January 24th, 2014

- Office hours are in full swing, see the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1ea0dfillqvhlop8d7t0m8afuo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America/New_York) for details
  - Mine are going to change starting next week; more details to follow...
- Registration issues should be largely taken care of by now
- [Lab 1](../labs/lab01/index.html): how did it go?
  - We hope to have it graded in "one week"
  - Lab accounts: if your password does not work, please email [root@cs.virginia.edu](mailto:root@cs.virginia.edu) to request it be changed; those who are still in the process of registration should get one later today
- [Lab 2](../labs/lab02/index.html) is out -- it's a ***BIG*** lab, so please don't wait until the last minute to start!
  - We have great TAs, but they are still a finite resource during office hours
  - Remember that for the pre-lab, you have to have a lot of it devleoped, not fully working
  - But it still must compile, else no credit!
- UNIX honor pledge
  - I am aiming to have that signed in lab next week -- recall that you can't use IDEs
  - Apparently the default action in the lab computers when double clicking on a .cpp file is loading up [Geany](http://www.geany.org), which is an IDE, so you can't use that...
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format
  - From [cs2150/index.html](index.html), click on the right-most link in the 'Semester Schedule' table
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/page/a2056666-5b8f-40b6-8591-f73174a47bbf)!  It's through Collab
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the github repo
- Today we will continue with [C++](../slides/02-cpp.html), which will take us into next week
  - Next up: [Lists](../slides/03-lists.html)

## Lecture 4: Wednesday, January 22nd, 2014

- Office have started, see the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1ea0dfillqvhlop8d7t0m8afuo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America/New_York) for details
- Registration issues: a new lab opened up, AND registraion restrictions removed AND the lab registration cap was (finally) raised
  - I am going to raise the lecture caps to 130 each
  - Those who register late for the course should submit a support request, once you are able to, to request an extnesion for lab 1
  - A max of 45 can be registered for the Olsson 001 labs (and a max of 14 for the Rice 340 lab)
  - Which means if you are still on the waitlist, you will have to switch to a different section or take the class next semester
- Yesterday's "snow day" (or "snow evening", more accurately)
  - If you need an in-lab extension due to not being able to make lab due to the snow, please submit a support request
- Lab 1: how is it going?
  - Lab accounts: if your password does not work, please email [root@cs.virginia.edu](mailto:root@cs.virginia.edu) to request it be changed
  - Those who are still in the process of registration should get one by the end of this week
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format

## Lecture 3: Friday, January 17th, 2014

- Office hours will start on Sunday, schedule still to be determined
- No class on Monday!  But we will have *SOME* of the office hours
 - See the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1ea0dfillqvhlop8d7t0m8afuo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America/New_York) for details, when they are posted
- Registration issues: a new lab opened up, AND registraion restrictions removed
  - I will be increasing the caps of the existing labs, but that still won't be enough space in lab section 101 for all 10 people on the wait list...
- Lab 1 is out
  - There is a wiki page [here](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/tool/58e790ee-ac9e-4001-9947-ebf5df8a8df5?pageName=%2Fsite%2F7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c%2Fgetting+the+git+repo+for+the+first+time&action=printview&panel=Main&breadcrumb=0&realm=%2Fsite%2F7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c) on how to get started with the github repo prior to getting the VirtualBox image installed; you'll need this to see *how* to install and configure VirtualBox
  - The VirtualBox image will need [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip it
  - The assignment submission will automatically open Sunday at noon
- Your lab accounts and passwords will be e-mailed to you today or Monday; bring your Linux password with you to lab on Tuesday!
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format
  - From [cs2150/index.html](index.html), click on the right-most link in the 'Semester Schedule' table
  - Apparently Monday's lecture is stuck in a zoom-into-upper-right-corner mode (sorry!)
