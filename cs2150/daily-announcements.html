## Lecture 6: Monday, January 27, 2014

- Office are in full swing, see the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1ea0dfillqvhlop8d7t0m8afuo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America/New_York) for details
  - Mine are now Mondays 2-3:30 and Thursdays 10:30-noon
- Registration issues should be all taken care of by now
- [Lab 1](../labs/lab01/index.html)
  - We hope to have it graded in "one week"
  - Lab accounts: if your password does not work, please email [root@cs.virginia.edu](mailto:root@cs.virginia.edu) to request it be changed; those who registered late should have gotten one last Friday
- [Lab 2](../labs/lab02/index.html) is out -- how is it going?
  - We have a finite number of TAs, so please don't wait until the last minute...
  - Remember that for the pre-lab, you have to have a lot of it devleoped, not fully working
  - But it still must compile, else no credit!
- UNIX honor pledge
  - I am aiming to have that signed in lab this week -- recall that you can't use IDEs
  - Apparently the default action in the lab computers when double clicking on a .cpp file is loading up [Geany](http://www.geany.org), which is an IDE, so you can't use that...
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format
  - From [cs2150/index.html](index.html), click on the right-most link in the 'Semester Schedule' table
  - I can't fix the issue with the first lecture's recording...  :-(
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/page/a2056666-5b8f-40b6-8591-f73174a47bbf)!  It's through Collab
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are listed in the github repo
- Today we should finish with [C++](../slides/02-cpp.html), and then onto [Lists](../slides/03-lists.html)

## Lecture 4: Wednesday, January 22, 2014

- Office have started, see the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1ea0dfillqvhlop8d7t0m8afuo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America/New_York) for details
- Registration issues: a new lab opened up, AND registraion restrictions removed AND the lab registration cap was (finally) raised
  - I am going to raise the lecture caps to 130 each
  - Those who register late for the course should submit a support request, once you are able to, to request an extnesion for lab 1
  - A max of 45 can be registered for the Olsson 001 labs (and a max of 14 for the Rice 340 lab)
  - Which means if you are still on the waitlist, you will have to switch to a different section or take the class next semester
- Yesterday's "snow day" (or "snow evening", more accurately)
  - If you need an in-lab extension due to not being able to make lab due to the snow, please submit a support request
- Lab 1: how is it going?
  - Lab accounts: if your password does not work, please email [root@cs.virginia.edu](mailto:root@cs.virginia.edu) to request it be changed
  - Those who are still in the process of registration should get one by the end of this week
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format
  - From [cs2150/index.html](index.html), click on the right-most link in the 'Semester Schedule' table
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/page/a2056666-5b8f-40b6-8591-f73174a47bbf)!  It's through Collab

## Lecture 3: Friday, January 17, 2014

- Office hours will start on Sunday, schedule still to be determined
- No class on Monday!  But we will have *SOME* of the office hours
 - See the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1ea0dfillqvhlop8d7t0m8afuo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America/New_York) for details, when they are posted
- Registration issues: a new lab opened up, AND registraion restrictions removed
  - I will be increasing the caps of the existing labs, but that still won't be enough space in lab section 101 for all 10 people on the wait list...
- Lab 1 is out
  - There is a wiki page [here](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/tool/58e790ee-ac9e-4001-9947-ebf5df8a8df5?pageName=%2Fsite%2F7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c%2Fgetting+the+git+repo+for+the+first+time&action=printview&panel=Main&breadcrumb=0&realm=%2Fsite%2F7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c) on how to get started with the github repo prior to getting the VirtualBox image installed; you'll need this to see *how* to install and configure VirtualBox
  - The VirtualBox image will need [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip it
  - The assignment submission will automatically open Sunday at noon
- Your lab accounts and passwords will be e-mailed to you today or Monday; bring your Linux password with you to lab on Tuesday!
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format
  - From [cs2150/index.html](index.html), click on the right-most link in the 'Semester Schedule' table
  - Apparently Monday's lecture is stuck in a zoom-into-upper-right-corner mode (sorry!)
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/page/a2056666-5b8f-40b6-8591-f73174a47bbf)!  It's through Collab

## Lecture 2: Wednesday, January 15, 2014

- Office hours will start on Sunday, schedule still to be determined
- Registration issues: a new lab opened up, which helps somewhat
  - I will be increasing the caps of the existing labs (and removing the registration restriction)
  - This will hopefully solve most (if not all) of the registration issues
- Lab 1 will be out today or tomorrow
  - When it's ready, it will be posted on the twitter feed: [@UVaCS2150](https://twitter.com/@UVaCS2150)
  - The VirtualBox image is already uploaded, but will need [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip it
  - The assignment submission will automatically open Sunday at noon
- Your lab accounts and passwords will be e-mailed to you late this week or (more likely) Monday; bring your Linux password with you to lab on Tuesday!
- Monday's lecture is posted online in a Flash movie format
  - From the [cs2150/index.html](index.html) file in the git archive, click on the right-most link in the 'Semester Schedule' table
- Anonymous feedback!  It's through Collab
- We will see a brief tour of the Collab workspace and the git repo today
- Interested in installing Linux on your machine?
  - The dept uses Ubuntu, which is what is on the VirtualBox image
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- Today we will finish with the [course introduction](../slides/01-intro.html), and start on [C++](../slides/02-cpp.html), which will continue through all of next week
