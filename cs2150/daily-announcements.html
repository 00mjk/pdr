- Please remember that forked PDR repos w/work included ***MUST*** remain private!

3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.

## Midterm procedure
- This is the procedure for both midterms this semester
- It is taken during your normal lab section
- The first rule of 2150 midterm is that you don't speak about 2150 midterm
  - (Translation: it is an honor violation to speak about it to somebody who has not taken it yet)
- You have to fill out the [bubble footer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/images/exam-footer.jpg) at the bottom of the first page of the exam
  - And put your name and UVa userid at the top of each page
  - And sign the honor pledge
- There will be a review session, likely the evening of the Sunday prior
- We hope to have it graded later that week (Wednesday evening is our grading party)
  - Its completion will generate my first (of four!) course-wide emails
- There will not be office hours the Wednesday and Thursday of a midterm week
- Obviously, no lab is released at the end of the week prior to the midterm
  - But one will be released the week *of* a midterm for the following week

## Grades and regrades
- Our aim is to return the lab grades "one week" later
  - That means by Monday a week after the post-lab is due (late deadline is on a Saturday)
  - We may not always manage this...
- All grading guidelines are posted in the Collab wiki (*not* in the github repo!)
- You 10 days, from when it was returned, to submit a regrade
  - Fill them out via the [regrades tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=regrades.php)
- Regrades are ONLY if we did not properly follow the grading guidelines in your homework
  - They are not an opportunity to make up the work!
  - Nor are they an opportunity to dispute the grading guidelines (that's to be done in person)
- Regrades will not be handled in a timely fashion!
  - It's the lowest priority, and they often wait until the end of the semester
  - You can see your submitted regrade status via the [regrades tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=regrades.php)
  - You will receive an email when it is handled
