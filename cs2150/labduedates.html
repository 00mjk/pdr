<h1>Lab Due Dates Page</h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the CS 2150 documents page</a></p>

<p>All assignments will be submitted through our custom assignments tool,
which can be accessed through Collab. Each assignment has 3 dates: an
open date (when you can start submitting the assignment), a due date
(when it is due), and a close date (the last point that you can submit
the assignment). The dates are listed for the week of the lab; the lab
week starts on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday. In particular, the due
date for the pre-labs, as well as the open date for both the in-labs
and post-labs, is when the first Tuesday lab section starts. The close
date for the post-labs is the start of Friday&rsquo;s lecture (the first
lecture, if there are multiple lecture periods).</p>

<p>Any late lab part will receive 25% off (for that lab part) for the
first 24 hours (or part thereof) that it is late, after which no
credit will be given. Note that a computer program does this deduction
&ndash; so if your lab is 1 second late, it still receives 25% off.  Beyond
24 hours late, that lab part will receive zero credit.</p>

<p>A lab extension for an in-lab will extend the due date until the end
of the day on Wednesday; lab extensions are discussed in <a href="../labs/lab01/lab01.html">Lab
1</a>.  For the pre-labs and post-labs, the
close date is exactly 24 hours after the due date, due to the above
mentioned late policy.</p>

<p>Below are the dates when the various assignments for the lab parts
open, due, and close.</p>
