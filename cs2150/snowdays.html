<p>This document is the same as the e-mail that was sent out to the entire class on Monday, March 17, 2014.</p>

<hr />

<p>With the advent of the third snow day for M/W/F classes, a number of changes will have to be made to the schedule.  I don&rsquo;t want to delay the lecture progress any more, as that will thrown off all the future labs.  So here goes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The in-lab and post-lab for <a href="../labs/lab07/index.html">Lab 7: IBCM</a> are canceled</li>
<li>The pre-lab for <a href="../labs/lab07/index.html">Lab 7: IBCM</a>, which is the only part of lab 7 that will be due, is now due at Friday at 9 a.m. (the normal post-lab due time) &ndash; thus, you need not make it to office hours today, in the snow, to get help with the pre-lab</li>
<li>Lab sessions on Tuesdays are optional this week, as there is no in-lab; the TAs will be present, and you can go if you want help with the pre-lab material</li>
<li>The IBCM material will still be on the exams</li>
<li>There will be a second IBCM lecture recorded, which you will have to watch on your own

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/lectures/08-ibcm-1/08-ibcm-1.htm">first lecture</a> is currently on Collab</li>
<li>The <a href="https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/lectures/08-ibcm-2/08-ibcm-2.htm">second lecture</a> will be uploaded to Collab once it is ready (likely mid-day on Monday, March 17th)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to have to ask you to watch the videos outside of lecture.  It was only because of the three snow days that this happened&hellip;</p>
