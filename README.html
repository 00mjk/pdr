<h1>Program and Data Representation</h1>

<p>This repository contains the materials for the course entitled &ldquo;CS
2150: Program and Data Representation&rdquo; at the University of Virginia.
It will contain all of the slides, labs, exams, etc. used throughout
the course.</p>

<p>This course is a second-year course for computer science majors.  It
is the primary data structures course in the University of Virginia&rsquo;s
computer science curriculum.  Unlike many other data structure courses
at other institutions, it is intended as the <em>third</em> course in
sequence, meaning that students are expected to have taken two
semesters of Java (or equivalent, although some of the examples are
specifically from Java).</p>

<p>The contents of this repository will be filled in throughout the
spring 2014 semester as the materials are developed (or, more
specifically, as they are converted into a git-friendly form and added
to this repository).  It is likely that this repository will be
largely incomplete until the spring 2014 semester is completed
(completion date is May, 2014).</p>

<p>The primary author is <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb">Aaron
Bloomfield</a>,
<a href="mailto:aaron@virginia.edu">aaron@virginia.edu</a>,

2014 semester will be the 14th consecutive semester I have taught the
course.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p><strong>Note that the links below will not work correctly if you are viewing
this via the github repo &ndash; you will need to download the repo first</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>book/: the beginnings of a textbook to be used for this course.  It
is written using LaTeX.</li>
<li><a href="docs/index.html">docs</a>: a series of usefull documents that are not
labs or tutorials.  To view these fiels, see the
<a href="docs/index.html">docs/index.html</a> file.</li>
<li><a href="cs2150/index.html">cs2150</a>: the materials that are specific to CS
2150 as taught at the University of Virginia, such as daily
announcements, due dates, etc.  To view these files, see the
<a href="cs2150/index.html">cs2150/index.html</a> file.</li>
<li>exams/: past exams for the course; there are two midterms and a
final for each semester.  Currently they are all in PDF format, but
that may change in the future.  The more recent ones were developed
using LaTeX, the earlier ones using Word.</li>
<li><a href="labs/index.html">labs</a>: the labs are the main assignments in the
course, and each lab is split into pre-lab, in-lab, and post-lab
parts. To view the labs, see the <a href="labs/index.html">labs/index.html</a>
file.  There are 11 full labs, with a partial 12th lab that is an
optional component of the course.  The labs are written using
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>, and the
rendered HTML version of each lab is also committed to this
repository.</li>
<li><a href="slides/index.html">slides</a>: Contains the slides used in the course; view
<a href="slides/index.html">slides/index.html</a> for the table of contents.
The slides use <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">reveal.js</a>, a
HTML presentation framework.</li>
<li><a href="tutorials/index.html">tutorials</a>: the tutorials that are used as
part of the lab assignments, these are primarily Linux tutorials.
To view the tutorials, see the
<a href="tutorials/index.html">tutorials/index.html</a> page.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Markdown</h2>

<p>The majority of the content in this repository was created using
Markdown.  Unfortunately, the only standardized Markdown is very old
(2004), and has limited support for many HTML features, such as
tables.  Indeed, the default Ubuntu version of Markdown is the 2004
version.  To address this, a <a href="utils/markdown.c.html">markdown.c</a>
(<a href="utils/markdown.c">src</a>) program was written to use more recent
Markdown features.  This program uses the libmarkdown library, which
does support more recent Markdown features.  This library installed
on Ubuntu via the &lsquo;libmarkdown2-dev&rsquo; package.  Note that reveal.js,
which is used for the slides, also supports more modern Markdown
features.</p>

<p>The resulting document is a full HTML document &ndash; meaning it adds the
doctype, html, head, and body tags to the document, as necessary.</p>

<p>To compile: &ldquo;gcc markdown.c -o markdown -lmarkdown&rdquo;. To use, specify
the input file name, and optionally an output file.</p>

<p>That being said, the extra Markdown features used in this repository
should be compatible with the generally accepted Markdown features.</p>

<p>For all the Markdown files, both the original (.md) file and the HTML
version (.html) are added to the repository, so that people who do not
have Markdown installed can still view the contents of this
repository.</p>

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>All source code is formatted via astyle and then highlighted via
source-highlight.  Both the original (foo.cpp) and the highlihged
version (foo.cpp.html) are included in the repo.  All links to source
code will like to the .html, with a &ldquo;(<a href="...">src</a>)&rdquo; after it
to link to the original source code.</p>

<ul>
<li>astyle options: -A2 -s4 &ndash;indent-switches</li>
<li>source-highlight options: -d</li>
</ul>


<h2>Canvas notes</h2>

<p>To add a canvas to a slide (to allow drawing with a mouse or a
stylus), you must do three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The slide can NOT be Markdown, it must be all pure HTML</li>
<li>include the js/canvas.js and css/dhtmlwindow.js scripts, as well as
the dhtmlwindow.css CSS file

<ul>
<li>the two dhtmlwindow.* files are only if you want to enable
cailbration</li>
<li>the code to create the dynamic HTML window (from the
dhtmlwindow.js and dhtmlwindow.css files) are only called if the
calibrate button is pressed, so if you do not include calibation,
there is no need to include that file</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>include the css/dhtmlwindow.css CSS file (but only if you want to
enable cailbration)</li>
<li>add an <code>onload="init()"</code> to the body tag</li>
<li>add the following line in a slide:
<code>&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;insertCanvas(42);&lt;/script&gt;</code><br/>
The parameter provided (42 in this case) need to be a number, and must
be unique (i.e., each slide needs to have a separate number).</li>
</ol>


<p>A few other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The canvas is larger than the slide itself, and the amount is the
<code>canvas_border</code> variable in the canvas.js file</li>
<li>To add colors, add them to the <code>colors</code> array in the canvas.js
file</li>
</ul>


<p>Currently, calibration is disabled, but to enable it, you would add
the following code at the end of the .html file (just before the three
script tags).  Also, the HTML code to insert the calibrate button
needs to be un-commented (in the insertCanvas() javascript function).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="calibratediv" style="display:none"&gt;
  &lt;div id="calibratecanvasdiv"&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="calibratecanvas" width="300" height="300"&gt;Your browser does not support the canvas tag&lt;/canvas&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Click the center of the target&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="#" onClick="calibratewin.close(); return false"&gt;Close window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
