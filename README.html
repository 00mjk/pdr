<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This repository contains the materials for the course entitled &ldquo;CS
2150: Program and Data Representation&rdquo; at the University of Virginia.
It will contain all of the slides, labs, exams, etc. used throughout
the course.  The course description is <a href="#description">below</a>.</p>

<p>Students in the course should view the
<a href="cs2150/index.html">cs2150/index.html</a> file in the <strong>cloned</strong> repo
(i.e., don&rsquo;t try to view it on github.com).</p>

<p>The contents of this repository will be filled in throughout the
spring 2014 semester as the materials are developed (or, more
specifically, as they are converted into a git-friendly form and added
to this repository).  It is likely that this repository will be
largely incomplete until the spring 2014 semester is completed;
completion date is May, 2014.</p>

2014 semester will be the 14th consecutive semester I have taught the
course.</p>

<h2><a name="contributing"></a>Contributing to this Repository</h2>

<p>Updates to the repository are restricted to approved individuals only,
to prevent anybody from messing with the slides right before a
lecture.  However, others can still contribute to this repository &ndash;
to do so, take the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a github account, if you do not have one</li>
<li>Fork this repository: you can click on the &ldquo;Fork&rdquo; link in the upper
right, or just click
<a href="https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr/fork">here</a></li>
<li>Clone your forked repository on to your local machine</li>
<li>Make any changes you want to your forked version, then commit and
push your changes back to your forked repo</li>
<li>Create a pull request, following the instructions
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">here</a></li>
</ol>


<p>At that point, I will receive a notice that a change has been
submitted, and I&rsquo;ll look at it and hopefully accept it into the main
repository.</p>

<h2><a name="description"></a>Course Description</h2>

<p>This course is a second-year course for computer science majors.  It
is the primary data structures course in the University of Virginia&rsquo;s
computer science curriculum.  Unlike many other data structure courses
at other institutions, it is intended as the <em>third</em> course in
sequence, meaning that students are expected to have taken two
semesters of Java (or equivalent, although some of the examples are
specifically from Java).  The course focuses on how programs and data
are represented from the high level down to the low level.  For
programs, we examine (from high to low): abstract data types, Java
code, C++ code, C code, assembly (x86) code, and a customized machine
language.  For data, we examine (also from high to low): abstract data
types, objects, primitive types, and how numbers are encoded (both
floats (IEEE 754) and integers (two&rsquo;s complement)).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.abet.org">ABET</a> course objects are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand program representation from the high-level programming
language perspective down to the underlying machine level
representation, including: number representation, operations,
conditionals, and control structures</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic and advanced abstract data types in C++
including: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and
graphs</li>
<li>Be able to evaluate asymptotic time and space complexity analysis of
programs and data structure implementations using Big-O, Big-Omega,
and Big-Theta notation and assess the suitability of a data structure
for a particular problem</li>
<li>Understand the basic program execution model and the underlying
computer hardware and software (fetch-execute cycle, memory hierarchy,
operating system, compiler)</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic program control and data structures in an
assembly language (loops, conditionals, subroutines and parameter
passing modes, arrays)</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="markdown"></a>Markdown</h2>

<p>The majority of the content in this repository was created using
Markdown.  Unfortunately, the only standardized Markdown is very old
(2004), and has limited support for many HTML features, such as
tables.  Indeed, the default Ubuntu version of Markdown is the 2004
version.  To address this, a <a href="utils/markdown.c.html">markdown.c</a>
(<a href="utils/markdown.c">src</a>) program was written to use more recent
Markdown features.  This program uses the libmarkdown library, which
does support more recent Markdown features.  This library installed on
Ubuntu via the &lsquo;libmarkdown2-dev&rsquo; package.  Note that reveal.js, which
is used for the slides, also supports more modern Markdown features.
That being said, the extra Markdown features used in this repository
should be compatible with the generally accepted Markdown features.</p>

<p>To compile: &ldquo;gcc markdown.c -o markdown -lmarkdown&rdquo;. To use, specify
the input file name, and optionally an output file.  The resulting
document is a full HTML document &ndash; meaning it adds the doctype, html,
head, and body tags to the document, as necessary.</p>

<p>For all the Markdown files, both the original (.md) file and the HTML
version (.html) are added to the repository, so that people who do not
have Markdown installed can still view the contents of this
repository.</p>

<p>Note that Github supports an enhanced version of Markdown, called
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">Github Flavored
Markdwon</a>,
or GFM.  This mostly pertains to this README file.  In an effort to
ensure compatibility with other Markdown programs (such as the one
described here), GFM specific features are generally avoided.  One
example is the use of anchors in this document &ndash; the HTML tags are
included instead of using GFM&rsquo;s version.</p>

<h2><a name="sourcecode"></a>Source code</h2>

<p>All source code is formatted via astyle and then highlighted via
source-highlight.  Both the original (foo.cpp) and the highlihged
version (foo.cpp.html) are included in the repo.  All links to source
code will like to the .html, with a &ldquo;(<a href="...">src</a>)&rdquo; after it
to link to the original source code.</p>

<ul>
<li>astyle options: -A2 -s4 --indent-switches</li>
<li>source-highlight options: -d</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="canvasnotes"></a>Canvas notes</h2>

<p>To add a canvas to a slide (to allow drawing with a mouse or a
stylus), you must do a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The slide can NOT be Markdown, it must be all pure HTML</li>
<li>include the js/canvas.js and css/dhtmlwindow.js scripts, as well as
the dhtmlwindow.css CSS file (the two dhtmlwindow.* files are for
the calibration feature)</li>
<li>include the css/dhtmlwindow.css CSS file (but only if you want to
enable cailbration)</li>
<li>add an <code>onload="init()"</code> to the body tag</li>
<li><p>add the following immediately after the body tag (this is for
the calibration feature):</p>

<pre><code> &lt;div id="dhtmlwindowholder"&gt;&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>add the following code at the end of the .html file (just before
the three script tags):</p>

<pre><code> &lt;div id="calibratediv" style="display:none"&gt;
   &lt;div id="calibratecanvasdiv"&gt;
     &lt;canvas id="calibratecanvas" width="300" height="300"&gt;Your
                   browser does not support the canvas tag&lt;/canvas&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;Click the center of the target&lt;br&gt;&lt;a 
                   href="#" onClick="calibratewin.close(); return
                   false"&gt;Close window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>Then, on each slide, you add the following:<br/>
<code>&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;insertCanvas();&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

<p>A few other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The canvas is larger than the slide itself, and the amount is the
<code>canvas_border</code> variable in the canvas.js file</li>
<li>To add colors, add them to the <code>colors</code> array in the canvas.js
file; more color names can be found
<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/html5_color_names.htm">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
