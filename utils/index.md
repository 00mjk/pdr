The contents of this directory are:

- [markdown.c](markdown.c.html) ([src](markdown.c)): a file to convert
  Markdown files using a more modern form of Markdown than the 2004
  version that installs with Ubuntu.  See the [Markdown section of the
  main README](../README.html#markdown) for more details.
- [convert](convert): a shell script that will do a first take at
  converting text files in Radeox wiki format (what all my labs and
  such were in previously) to Markdown.  Note that this program
  assumes the cut-and-paste was done on a Mac (if done on a different
  OS, then there are different characters that are substituted for the
  non-ASCII characters).
