Program and Data Representation
===============================

This is the **OLD** repository for the course CS 2150, Program and Data Representation, taught at the University of Virginia.  I ([Aaron Bloomfield](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb)) taught this class for 20 consecutive semesters, from the fall of 2007 to the spring of 2017; the last 7 of these semesters have their content in this repository.

The current repository for the course is [markfloryan/pdr](https://github.com/markfloryan/pdr).  This repository ([aaronbloomfield/pdr](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr)) is no longer being updated.

If you want to see the final contents of the repo when I last taught this course (spring 2017), you can view them [here](readme-old.html) ([md](readme-old.md)).  Again, the current iteration of this course can be found at [markfloryan/pdr](https://github.com/markfloryan/pdr).

If you want to view a previous version of this repository, then you can view a tag from that semester.  All tags are of the form `2014-spring`.  You can view the contents of a tag online (at a URL such as [https://github.com/markfloryan/pdr/tree/2016-fall](https://github.com/markfloryan/pdr/tree/2016-fall)) or checkout a specific tag on the command line via a command such as `git checkout tags/2016-fall`.
