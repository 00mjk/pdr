<h1>Laboratory 1: Introduction to C++</h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>This is laboratory is intended to get you up to speed quickly with
both C++ and Unix.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Every week we will have a lab meeting.  Each lab will consist of three
parts: a pre-lab (to be completed by Tuesday at the due time listed on
the "Lab due dates page"), an in-lab (activity to be done during lab),
and a post-lab.  The pre-lab will also include a tutorial.  Parts of
all three of these may be required to turned in.  The due dates are
all listed on the "Lab due dates page".  This will all be discussed in
this lab.</p>

<h3>Reading(s)</h3>

<ol>
<li>Tutorial 1: Introduction to UNIX</li>
<li>Optional: online sources as posted on the Readings page</li>
</ol>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<h3>Pre-lab</h3>

<ol>
<li>If desired, the alternative readings are available on the Readings
page on the Collab wiki.</li>
<li>Complete the introductory tutorial on using Unix found in Collab
(in the tutorials folder of the Resources section of Collab).</li>
<li>Write the xToN.cpp file, as described in the pre-lab section.  If
you are unfamiliar with the Collab submission system, read through the
in-lab section of the document.  Submit this file.</li>
<li>Examine the Object life-cycle code posted in the labs directory on
Collab (lifecycle.cpp).  You may not understand everything in this
program by the beginning of lab, but you should by the end of next
week.  We will be using this program during the in-lab activity.</li>
<li>Read how to reboot into Linux for the in-lab.  Although the TAs
will be able to help you, you should still have an idea how to do
it.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Pre-lab</h2>

<p>First, complete the Unix tutorial found in Collab.  For this course,
you will need to be familiar with Emacs.  You are welcome to use any
editor that is not an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), but we
expect that you are very familiar with Emacs for the exams, including
the keyboard shortcuts!</p>

<p>Below is a sample function with a main() function that calls it.  The
source code for this and other examples from the book is on the Collab
site (in the Resources section under misc/textbooks).  You may find
this and other examples helpful in writing your function to compute
~x^n and the main function to call it.  Note that this code has been
modified from the book version to allow for user input (the second and
third lines of the main() function).</p>

<pre><code>include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// Correct implementation of swap2
void swap2( int &amp; a, int &amp; b ) {
    int tmp = a;
    a = b;
    b = tmp;
}

int main( ) {
    int x, y;
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
    cin &gt;&gt; y;
    swap2( x, y );
    cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Important note: the ampersands ('&amp;') in the parameter list of swap2()
means that they are passed as <em>references</em> - we have not seen
references yet, and won't until the third week of classes.  The short
version is that the fact that the ampersands are there allows the
values of x and y (both of which are in main()) to be changed in the
subroutine.  For your x^n program, you do not need to use references
or ampersands.</p>

<p>For the pre-lab, you will need to write a recursive function called
xton() to compute x^n for nonnegative integers <em>n</em>.  Assume that
x^0=1.  Put this function in a program with a main() function.  Your
program should prompt the user for two integer values, and raise the
first to the power of the second by calling your xton() function.</p>

<p>The file should be called xToN.cpp, and should be submitted to the
pre-lab 1 assignment in the Collab submission system.</p>

<p>Note that your program should take in <strong>exactly two inputs and nothing
else</strong>.  We are going to run it through an automated grading script
prior to the TAs grading it -- if your program takes in a different
number of inputs, you will receive points off.</p>

<p>Lastly, take a look at the object life-cycle code (lifecycle.cpp).
Use it as a mechanism for understanding how various aspects of C++
work. Compile and run the program (in Unix -- see step 3a in the
in-lab section).  Try stepping through it by hand.  Use the readings,
the web, and any other C++ references to help you look up parts of the
program you do not understand.</p>

<h3>Linux in Olsson 001</h3>

<p>This section describes how to log into Linux in Olsson 001.  Although
this is really part of the in-lab, you won't be able to access this
document until you have logged in, which is why the directions are
listed in the pre-lab section.</p>

<p>The machines in Olsson 001 have two operating systems installed --
Windows and Linux (the Ubuntu distribution).  You have accounts on
each, although the passwords will be separate.  You will need to
reboot the computer into Linux -- to do this, do a regular reboot from
Windows.  Upon the reboot, after the Dell logo screen is shown, a boot
loader screen will appear, allowing you to choose which operating
system to load.  There are a number of choices, but the one we are
interested in is the Ubuntu choice (there are two -- ignore the 'safe
mode' version).  You will note that the default selection is Windows
-- you will have to use the arrow keys to select the Ubuntu line, and
then hit Enter.</p>

<p>Once the login screen appears, you can log in.  Be aware that it may
take a full minute to log you into the machine.  Linux has a number of
<em>desktop environments</em> that one can choose from -- each of these has a
different look-and-feel, in the same way that Windows is different
from Mac OS X.  We are currently using Gnome (pronounced 'ga-nome',
not 'nome').  We may later see another one called KDE, and you will be
able to choose whichever one you prefer more.</p>

<p>In Gnome, you will notice that the task bar is at the top.  There is a
Firefox icon there that you can use to launch a web browser to log
into Collab (https://collab.virginia.edu) and complete the lab.  You
will also need to load up a terminal window -- to do this, click on
'Applications' at the top, and select Accessories ->Terminal.</p>

<p>When you are finished, you should log out (from the menu at the top,
or you can hit Ctrl-Alt-Backspace), and reboot the computer (through
the options menu at the bottom of the login screen).</p>

<h2>In-lab</h2>

<h3>General In-lab Procedure</h3>

<p>The purpose of the labs is to allow you to work through the lab
activity, and if you encounter questions or problems, ask for TA
assistance.  Note that each file you electronically submit (including
text files!) should contain a header containing your name, email ID,
file name, and the date.
All of the files required for this lab are ...</p>

<h3>Understanding C++</h3>

<ol>
<li>Ask the TAs if you have questions about your x^n function.</li>
<li>Ask the TAs if you have questions about using Unix.</li>
<li>Object Lifecycle Program
<ul>
<li>Download the lifecycle.cpp file Compile with clang++ (i.e.,
'clang++ lifecycle.cpp') and execute the program.</li>
<li>Break lifecycle.cpp into multiple files.  It may be helpful to
look at class slides on the Collab site.  Compile and run this
program.  Note that to compile a C++ program with multiple files,
just put them on the same line: 'clang++ LifeCycle.cpp
TestLifeCycle.cpp' (you usually leave out the .h files when
compiling).  Add the descriptive header at the top of the file
containing your identifying information, and name them as
follows:
<ul>
<li>LifeCycle.h</li>
<li>LifeCycle.cpp</li>
<li>TestLifeCycle.cpp</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Comment out the prototype for getMaxMyObj.  Recompile.  What
happens and why?  Talk to TA if you are unsure.  Now un-comment
the prototype.</li>
<li>Look at the output of lifecycle.cpp.  Write at least one question
about something in this program. Write your questions in a text
file named lifecycle.questions.txt.  Remember to include the
header comment at the top of the file.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using C++ vector container class with strings
<ul>
<li>There are 3 files on the Collab site that demonstrate the use of
multi-file programs and the use of the vector collection class in
C++: svutil.cpp, svutil.h, and svtest.cpp.  This class is similar
to the ArrayList class in the Java standard library (or Java's
own Vector class).  Compile the program in Unix and run it.  The
command 'clang++ svutil.cpp svtest.cpp' will compile the program.</li>
<li>Comment out the #include <iostream> preprocessor directive in the
file svtest.cpp, and then rebuild the program.  Was there an error?</li>
<li>Now undo what you did in the previous step, but now comment out
the using namespace std; in svutil.h, and rebuild the
program. Was there an error?  What objects are now undeclared and
why?</li>
<li>Write at least one question about something in this program.
This question might be about something that you don't understand
completely. Write your questions in a file named
vector.questions.txt</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>Does your program not compile?  Here are a few things to try -- these
are problems that previous students have encountered.</p>

<ul>
<li>You must have #include <iostream> at the beginning of each file
(well, really each file that uses cin and cout, but it doesn't hurt
to have it at the beginning of each file).</li>
<li>Likewise, you will need using namespace std; at the beginning of
each file.</li>
<li>Is your subroutine a method (i.e. part of a class) or a function
(i.e. not part of a class)?  Make sure you know which is which!  A
method has its name in the form classname::methodname, whereas a
function doesn't have a class name or the double-colon.</li>
<li>Make sure that your subroutine names (whether they be function names
or method names) are consistent between the .h files and the .cpp
files</li>
<li>Have a compiler error that you don't understand?  We have the
translation!  See the wiki page, which lists common compiler error
messages, what they mean, and how to solve them.  If you don't see
yours listed there, let us know, and we'll add it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Capitalization</h3>

<p>Under Windows, the case of a file name is ignored -- thus,
lifecycle.cpp, LifeCycle.cpp, and LIFECYCLE.CPP all refer to the same
file.  However, it is NOT true for Linux, which is what we will use to
test and grade your code.  Thus, if your file is called 'LifeCycle.h',
and you have (in your TestLifeCycle.cpp file) a line that states:
#include "lifecycle.h", then your program will NOT work under Linux
(since case DOES matter with file names).  Since your code does not
compile, you will get zero credit.  So make sure your file names
match!</p>

<p>Under Windows, it is difficult to change the case of a file name (you
can't rename lifecycle.h to LifeCycle.h, since Windows sees those
as the same thing).  You may have to rename it to something else, then
rename it back.  Or change the case on your #include line.</p>

<h3>Assignment submission</h3>

<p>All assignments will be submitted through our custom assignments tool,
which can be accessed through Collab.  Each assignment has 3 dates: an
open date (when you can start submitting the assignment), a due date
(when it's due), and a close date (the last point that you can submit
the assignment).  The dates are listed for the week of the lab (the
lab week starts on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday).  In particular,
the due date for the pre-labs, as well as the open date for the
in-labs and post-labs is when the first lab section starts.  The close
date for the post-labs is the start of Friday's lecture (the first
lecture, if there are multiple lecture periods).</p>

<p>The various dates: open dates, due dates, and close dates, are listed
on the "Lab due dates page"</p>

<p>Please note, however, that there are a number of rules that we will
strictly follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-labs are due at the same time for everybody, regardless of your
lab section; that time is the beginning of the FIRST Tuesday lab.</li>
<li>In-labs are due at the end of your scheduled lab session, regardless
of what Collab states.  But see the part about in-lab extensions,
below.</li>
<li>An in-lab extension (see lab 1 for details) will postpone the in-lab
due date until 11:59:59 p.m. on Wednesday evening, regardless of your
lab section.</li>
<li>In-labs MUST be done from the lab in Olsson 001, or no credit will
be given for the ENTIRE lab.</li>
<li>Any late lab part will receive 25% off (for just that part) for the
first 24 hours (or part thereof) that it is late, after which no
credit will be given.  Note that a computer program does this
deduction -- so if your lab is 1 second late, it still receives 25%
off.</li>
<li>There is no penalty for in-lab extensions, neither is there a limit
to the number of weeks you can use them. The extended in-lab does
not need to be completed in Olsson 001.</li>
</ul>

<p>The assignments tool does not handle due dates such as "at the end of
your lab session" very well -- indeed, the due date is listed as 10
p.m. on Tuesdays.  Note that we have a script that will test the
assignment's due date against your lab date, so please be sure to
follow the above due dates.</p>

<h3>Lab Extensions</h3>

<p>You can automatically request a lab extension if you are unable to
complete your in-lab during the allotted time.  This is done through
the 'Lab Extension' tool in Collab.  Note that this only applies to
the in-lab.  The due date with the extension is the end of the day on
Wednesday (i.e. 11:59 p.m.), regardless of your lab section, as this
gives you a chance to go to the Wednesday evening office hours.</p>

<h3>Submitting your files</h3>

<p>All assignments for this course will be submitted through the 'Lab
Submission' link in Collab.  There is no check to make sure you have
submitted all of the correct files -- on the 'Procedure' page (always
the second page of the lab document), we clearly state which files
should be submitted for each lab part.  For example, for this in-lab,
you should submit the following files for in-lab 1:
lifecycle.questions.txt, vector.questions.txt, LifeCycle.h,
LifeCycle.cpp, and TestLifeCycle.cpp.</p>

<p>Lastly, you should ensure that your program compiles before you submit
it.  This is an advanced programming class, and there is no reason why
you should submit a program that does not compile.  If you are having
problems with your code, you should comment out parts so that it does
compile -- you will receive some credit for a program that has part of
the code commented out than a program that does not compile.</p>

<p>Just to be clear: <strong>you will receive zero credit for a lab component
which does not compile.</strong></p>

<h3>Resubmitting your assignment</h3>

<p>If you submit your assignment, and you realize you made a mistake
(didn't submit all the files, etc.), you can resubmit your assignment.
The date of submission is the date you re-submitted your assignment --
so if you resubmit your assignment after the due date to add one more
file, the ENTIRE assignment will have the late submission date.
Resubmitting is the same as submitting it the first time.</p>

<h2>Post-lab</h2>

<p>Complete the exercise below, and submit the text file described there
to the submission system.</p>

<p>For this lab you will be submitting your assignment electronically.
Your submission is on the Friday of the week of the lab; the exact
time is listed on the "Lab due dates page".  Be sure to include: your
name, the date, and the name of the file in a banner comment at the
beginning of each file you submit.</p>

<h3>Linked List Template code</h3>

<p>Download the four linked list files.  Compile and run the program.
The compile command is 'clang++ TestLinkedList.cpp' -- if you try to
compile the LinkedList.cpp file, it won't work correctly.  And the
dsexceptions.h file is necessary for this (you don't have to
understand it, but it must be present for the program to compile).</p>

<p>Find a #include statement at the end of LinkedList.h.  This is not the
way that #include is typically used. We normally only include files
that contain declarations of classes, constants, function prototypes,
etc., but not definitions of C++ functions (i.e. the bodies of the
functions). However, when implementing template classes, this is
something that is necessary to make the class compile successfully.</p>

<p>Look more closely at TestLinkedList.cpp.  The line:</p>

<p><code>
List&lt;int&gt; theList;
</code></p>

<p>declares a List of integers, called theList.  The line:</p>

<p><code>
List&lt;int&gt; list2;
</code></p>

<p>declares another List of integers, called list2.  Now all the
functions in the List class will be available to theList and list2.
In LinkedList.h and LinkedList.cpp, everywhere "Object" is used, int
will be used instead.</p>

<p>Write at least one question about something in this program.  Put your
question(s) in a text file called "postlab1.question.txt" and submit
this to the submission system to the post-lab 1 assignment.</p>
