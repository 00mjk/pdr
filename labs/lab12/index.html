<h2>Procedure</h2>

<h3>Pre-lab</h3>

<p>There is no pre-lab for this lab</p>

<h3>In-lab</h3>

<ol>
<li>While we are required to have you show up to lab today, we won&rsquo;t be taking up much of your time.</li>
<li>However, note that you still have to attend lab in Olsson 001 (or Rice 340), however briefly, and submit your file for this lab from there.</li>
<li>How much wrath do you have to vent about the course? How much did it ruin your life? How much did you learn? Let us know &ndash; fill out the course surveys! You can access them through Collab (or SIS? We aren&rsquo;t actually given any information about how students access the course evaluations). On a more serious note, we are very interested in your feedback about the course, and would greatly appreciate your filling out of the course evaluation.</li>
<li>The one text file you must submit for this lab is called suggestion.txt, and it should contain one <em>constructive</em> suggestion as to how to improve this course. Here, constructive means that it could actually be accomplished (so you can&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;ditch C++&rdquo; without some sort of suggestion as to what to place in it&rsquo;s stead).</li>
<li>Any other comments to pass on? There is always the Collab anonymous feedback for more comments as well.</li>
<li>There will be a review session for the final; the review session is Thursday, May 1st at 8 p.m.; room to be announced</li>
<li>The final exam is Saturday, May 3rd in Gilmer 130 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.</li>
<li>File to submit: suggestion.txt</li>
</ol>


<h3>Post-lab</h3>

<p>There is no post-lab for this lab. Good luck on your finals!</p>
